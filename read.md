Hello
My name is Jaison.
I am currently studying in SJEC Mangalore.
This is kind of like my first project.
But it couldn't work properly because chatGPT API issue.
You had to pay for it to work and I dont have money for that.
So this was an exciting experience.
The things i learnt include :
.gitignore
how to download and install packages 
how to connect to packages 
use of functions in packages
how to get api key for telegram using botfather
how to get api key for openai using OPENAIAPI

Thank you 
JaisoN
